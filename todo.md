### P2P server fun - things to do:

- [x] Create a seed file listing all seed servers address
- [x] Set env variable of `id` when starting a server
- [x] Get all the peers utility method
- [x] Node registeration flow with some seed server on startup
- [x] Create POST /send endpoint to send message
- [x] Create a GET /register endpoints so nodes can register themseleves with the given id and address
